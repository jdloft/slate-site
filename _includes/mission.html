                <p>SLATE is a new Cardano stake pool aimed at increasing Cardano awareness and helping others understand Cardano technology.</p>
                <p>The Cardano community is a wide and diverse array of developers and tech enthusiasts who want to change the way the world
                    functions financially. From new ways to connect, pay, and live, Cardano is poised to lead in the next
                    financial revolution. Unfortunately such a transition will not be possible if documentation and tutorials do not exist that
                    rival that power.</p>
                <p>SLATE is built by two normal people that are trying to help carry out Cardano's mission. We recognized the power of Cardano
                    and started learning about it back in July 2020. Since then we have been awed by the advancements in the technology.
                    However, we noticed a lack of user friendly tutorials for those looking to join the Cardano developer community. We aim to fix that.
                    With tutorials and articles written in plain English we hope to support the next blockchain wave with Cardano by empowering
                    the developers who will be building on it. If you would like to support our efforts,
                    please consider staking to our pool.</p>
                <p>Thank you.</p>
